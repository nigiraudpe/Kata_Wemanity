# Kata_Wemanity
## Project presentation
The aim of this project was to refactor an existing code which can be found at https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata.
The app was an item inventory with decreasing values at the end of each day and specific behaviour for some of the items (legendary or conjured ones for example)
This project uses PHP as programmation language and provides updated code and testing

## Running the app
To run this app, I used a WAMP server. I cloned the repo in the "www" folder of the wamp server then launched it.
On my browser I can now access to "http://localhost/Kata_Wemanity/php/src/gilded_rose.php" for example.
Then open the DevTools Console I can now see the output correctly in the <body> of my page.
  
## Testing
As TextTest makes my computer crashes every time I try to run it, I decided to create my own tests which may not look very confident but are still providing good results and display.
Tests can be found in the "test/gilded_rose_test.php" file
